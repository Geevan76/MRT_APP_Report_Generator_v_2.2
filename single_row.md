### Summary

- The order runs, most likely because its grouping the inspection ids and then populating the data onto google docs. Therefore something from in the middle can be at the top.
- We will be missing the remarks which is recorded in the inspection row
- They suggested, to have the images in a single row but that would add further complexities with row height and number of images which can differ in the future
- The other option to be experimented with is to add the remarks to the images and remove the inspection row completely (which can still be done as the next step with the code we currently have here)
